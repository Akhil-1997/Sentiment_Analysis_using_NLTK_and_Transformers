# Sentiment Analysis with VADER and RoBERTa

This project performs sentiment analysis on text data using two approaches: VADER (Valence Aware Dictionary and sEntiment Reasoner) and RoBERTa (Robustly optimized BERT approach). The project showcases how to analyze sentiment scores using these methods and compare their results visually.

## Overview

1. **Data Preparation**: Reads and preprocesses data from a CSV file containing text reviews.
2. **VADER Sentiment Scoring**: Uses the VADER sentiment analysis tool from the NLTK library to compute sentiment scores.
3. **RoBERTa Sentiment Analysis**: Uses a pre-trained RoBERTa model from Hugging Face Transformers to generate sentiment scores.
4. **Results Visualization**: Compares and visualizes sentiment scores obtained from VADER and RoBERTa using various plots.

## Dataset

The dataset used for sentiment analysis is sourced from Kaggle:
- **[Amazon Fine Food Reviews](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/snap/amazon-fine-food-reviews)**

The dataset includes reviews of fine foods from Amazon, with each review containing text and associated metadata.
